/**
 * Reshapes the station-shaped view model into the domain-shaped one the
 * metric-first canvas renders.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the information architecture decision.
 *
 * HORIZON has three stations but roughly ten measurements, and the
 * station-per-card layout that preceded this made the page answer "what
 * hardware exists?" when the question a reader actually arrives with is
 * "what is happening to the water and the soil?". Grouping by physical
 * domain answers the second question, and — because the domain a reading
 * belongs to is a property of the reading, not of the box it sits in — it
 * scales if a fourth station is ever added.
 *
 * Station identity is NOT discarded. Each group carries the station that
 * produced it, so attribution appears once as group context rather than
 * being repeated on all eight metric cells. That was the explicit
 * requirement: every metric must still reveal its source, without the page
 * printing "Trạm 2" six times.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry this deliberately produces: STATION_02 contributes to
 * BOTH the soil and air groups, because it physically carries both a soil
 * probe and an SHT30. A station-first layout hides that; a domain-first one
 * makes it visible, which is the more truthful description of the hardware.
