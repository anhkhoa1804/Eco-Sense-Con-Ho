/**
 * Theme resolution contract, shared by the no-flash boot script and the
 * toggle component so the two can never disagree about the storage key or
 * the attribute name.
 *
 * Three states, but only two are ever written to the DOM:
 *
 *   "system"  → no `data-theme` attribute at all; globals.css's
 *               `prefers-color-scheme` media query decides. This is the
 *               default until the reader touches the toggle.
 *   "light"   → `data-theme="light"` — beats a dark OS setting, because the
 *               media query is guarded by `:not([data-theme="light"])`.
 *   "dark"    → `data-theme="dark"` — beats a light OS setting via its own
 *               `:root[data-theme="dark"]` block.
 *
 * Nothing here decides a colour; it only decides which CSS block wins.
