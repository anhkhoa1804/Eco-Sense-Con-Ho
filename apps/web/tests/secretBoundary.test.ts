/**
 * The service-role key bypasses RLS completely. Every protection verified
 * against the live database — anon cannot write, cannot read damage_logs,
 * cannot read users — is void for anyone holding it. Shipping it to a browser
 * would hand every visitor full read/write on the whole schema.
 *
 * Nothing in the type system prevents that: a `"use client"` module importing
 * a server helper is a build-time error in Next, but a plain `process.env`
 * read in a shared module is not, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-prefixed variables are
 * inlined into the client bundle by design.
 *
 * These are cheap source-level guards for the mistakes that would actually
 * cause it.
