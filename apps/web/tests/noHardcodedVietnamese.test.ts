/**
 * The freeze guard for mixed-language UI.
 *
 * Phase 9.3 reported "401 hardcoded Vietnamese strings" using a scanner that
 * only matched QUOTED literals — so JSX text nodes (`<p>Bản ghi</p>`) were
 * invisible to it and the real figure was higher. This test scans the way a
 * reader experiences the page: any Vietnamese-specific diacritic in a source
 * file, comments excluded.
 *
 * Files fall into two sets:
 *
 *   INTERFACE  — must contain no Vietnamese. Labels, controls, validation,
 *                status words and empty states all resolve through
 *                lib/i18n, so an English reader never meets an untranslated
 *                fragment of chrome.
 *
 *   ALLOWED    — may contain Vietnamese, for a stated reason. Each entry
 *                carries its category so the list cannot quietly become a
 *                dumping ground:
 *                  D = Vietnamese-only editorial draft (disclosed in the UI
 *                      by <TranslationNotice/>)
 *                  B = proper nouns / place names
 *                  E = developer-facing or non-rendered fallback strings
 *
 * A NEW interface file with Vietnamese in it fails here rather than shipping.
