# Component Specification

## Purpose

This file translates product philosophy into implementation-level UI specifications. Use it when building reusable components. If a component is not listed here, model it after the closest existing component and document the new variant.

All components must use tokens from [`DESIGN_TOKENS.md`](DESIGN_TOKENS.md), language rules from [`COPYWRITING_GUIDE.md`](COPYWRITING_GUIDE.md), and accessibility requirements from [`ACCESSIBILITY_PERFORMANCE.md`](ACCESSIBILITY_PERFORMANCE.md).

## Shared component rules

- Components must be responsive from 320px upward.
- Components must expose loading, empty, error, and disabled states where relevant.
- Components must not rely on color alone.
- Components must not include one-off spacing, color, shadow, or animation values.
- Components must preserve layout dimensions during loading when possible.
- Components must keep public surfaces calmer and admin surfaces denser.

## MetricCard

### Purpose

Shows one environmental or device metric with value, unit, status, freshness, and trend.

2. Optional icon at top-right.
3. Large value with unit.
4. Status badge.
5. Trend or helper line.
6. Optional threshold line or comparison.

### Sizing and spacing

| Surface | Height | Padding | Radius | Gap |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Mobile public | min 132px | `space-5` | `radius-lg` | `space-3` |
| Desktop public | min 148px | `space-6` | `radius-lg` | `space-4` |
| Admin compact | min 112px | `space-4` | `radius-md` | `space-2` |

### Hierarchy

- Label: `text-sm`, muted.
- Value: `text-4xl` mobile, `text-5xl` desktop, tabular numerals.
- Unit: 40–55% of value size, aligned to baseline.
- Status badge: directly below value, never hidden in a tooltip.
- Trend: small and secondary.

### Icon placement

- Top-right only.
- Never center the icon.
- Never make the icon larger than the value.
- Decorative icons must be hidden from screen readers.

### States

| State | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Loading | Skeleton for label, value, badge, and trend; preserve card height. |
| Empty | Show `Chưa có dữ liệu` and explain the expected source. |
| Healthy | Calm green badge and plain-language confirmation. |
| Watch | Amber badge and short reason. |
| Risk | Red badge, reason, and recommended action. |
| Offline | Gray badge; show last received time if known. |
| Sensor fault | Fault badge; value may be hidden or marked unreliable. |

### Interaction

- Public cards are usually not clickable unless they navigate to detail.
- Hover on desktop may use `translateY(-1px)` and `elevation-sm`.
- No bounce, flip, glow, or number-counting animation.

### Accessibility

- Metric value and unit must be read as one phrase.
- Status must include text, not color only.
- Provide a screen-reader summary when trend icon is visual.
